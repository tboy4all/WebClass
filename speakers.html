            <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

            <p>
              Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball
              tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties,
              PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules,
              behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to
              get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be
              most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work
              in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the
              traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small.
              He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have
              that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to
              change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve
              worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s almost impossible to
              imagine yourself anywhere else.
            </p>

            <h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>

            <p>
              In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to
              pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat out
              a rhythm of learning &#8211; both of code and drum beats!
              You&#8217;ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner&#8217;s
              heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven,
              as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating
              seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.

            <h5>Leveling Up with Flexbox</h5>

            <p>
              By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard of &#8220;flexbox,&#8221;
              short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully
              developed and well supported of CSS3&#8217;s wide array of new
              layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive
              layouts without having to worry about all those pesky float layout
              quirks we&#8217;ve dealt with for over a decade. But with
              cross-browser support still incomplete, you&#8217;ve probably
              relegated flexbox to the &#8220;one day&#8221; pile of web design
              tricks.
            </p>

            <p>
              It&#8217;s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to
              convince you that it&#8217;s a good idea to start learning and
              using flexbox today. You&#8217;ll learn how to take your
              designs—and web design skills—to the next level as we use flexbox
              as practical progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces
              on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.
